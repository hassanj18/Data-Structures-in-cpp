# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains various implementations of fundamental data structures in C++. Each implementation is designed to provide a clear understanding of how different data structures function and their respective operations.

2. **Binary Search Tree** - `BinarySearchTree.cpp`
3. **Circular Linked List** - `CircularLinkedList.cpp`
4. **Doubly Linked List** - `DoublyLinkedList.cpp`
5. **Doubly Linked List with Iterators** - `DoublyLinkedListWithIterators.cpp`
6. **Graph (BFS & DFS)** - `Graph_BFS&DFS.cpp`
7. **HashMap with Linear & Quadratic Probing** - `HashMap_linear&QuadProbing.cpp`
8. **MinHeap (Priority Queue)** - `MinHeap_priorityQueue.cpp`

10. **Stack** - `Stack.cpp`

## Getting Started
To get a local copy of the project, clone it using the following command:

```bash
https://github.com/hassanj18/Data-Structures-in-cpp
```


### Prerequisites
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, clang++) to compile and run these implementations.

### Running the Code
Navigate to the directory of the specific data structure file you want to test and compile it using:

```bash
g++ <filename>.cpp -o <output_name>
```

Then run it:

```bash
./<output_name>
```

## Built with
- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
